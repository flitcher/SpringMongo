# Spring Boot with MongoDB Assignment project
This is a simple Java / MongoDB / Spring Boot application 
to show basic REST API functionalities as well as CREATE and READ operations on a resource.

# Requirements
For building and running the application you'll need:
* [JDK 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8)
* [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/)


# Getting started
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in 
the com.example.demo.DemoApplication class from your IDE.

# Useful resources
A popular design pattern widely adopted by the Spring Boot community is the use of a Controller-Service-Repository.
This [article](https://tom-collings.medium.com/controller-service-repository-16e29a4684e5) was useful for my understanding of Spring Boot which provided not only the how, but also the why.
